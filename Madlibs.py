# A Madlib production by me
madlibs = f"""Hey! Welcome to planet {noun}, my name is {name} and I will be giving you a {verb} around the place. 
Here you see a lot of our {noun2} eating fruits which is our main source of energy. It's quite funny to think {noun3}
created the {invention} but we accidentally delivered it to the wrong planet which was Earth. Anyways, in the distance

show you our finest {element} farm on the other side of the world."""
